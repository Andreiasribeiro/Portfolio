                <p>AR MOTOR Garage is booking system web-based application developed for a small garage,
                    which allows the usersto register  and book services available in the system.
                    There is a dashboard where the garageâ€™s owner can manage the bookings updating
                    them or adding additional parts, services, and allocating staff for each booking.
                    Also, one invoice can be generated with all information about the booking. </p>
                    <p>I have built this application in JavaScript, and the technologies used were React Js for the front-end,
                    Node Js for the API, and MongoDB to store data.</p>

                <p>This project was developed as a final graduation project for my Higher Diploma in Science in Computing at <a href="https://www.cct.ie/" target="_blank">CCT College Dublin</a>.</p>
