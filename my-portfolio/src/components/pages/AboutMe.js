          <p>I am passionate about art, design, technology, and I like to explore different areas, so I am always experimenting with new techniques and forms of expression in my work.
I have a curious mind, and I am always in search of challenges. I have recently completed a Higher Diploma in Science in Computing [NFQ Level 8] at CCT College Dublin.
I also have a bachelorâ€™s degree in Industrial design, and over 10 years of experience. Now I am seeking employment opportunities in the Technology sector, specifically in front-end development where I can continue to develop new skills whilst building on my existing experience and recent training.
